# Path Panda

Path Panda is a smart routing engine designed to calculate the cheapest (and eventually fastest) way to travel between any two Indian cities. It takes into account multiple transportation modes such as trains and buses, and uses an algorithmic approach to determine the optimal route.

## Overview of the Application

## Path-Panda is structured into three Components:

### 1. Data Pipeline

- This is the backend service responsible for fetching all transport-related data from external APIs and organizing it for storage and computation.
- IRCTC TRAIN DATA: From RapidAPI
- BUS ROUTES: Are webscraped and hardCoded

#### 1.0 Data Pipeline Sample

- Note: getTrains endPoint doesnt fetchs fare details, thats why another getFare endpoint is used to fetch fares for every train.

‚úÖ Responsibility: Pull data, compute minimum fares, and push structured city-pair data into the database.

### 2. Database(MongoDB)

This component stores all fare information between city pairs in a clean and searchable format. Example entries:

<Kanpur-Patiala>

<Delhi-Mumbai>

<CityA-CityB>

#### 1.0 Database Schema and Sample Data

‚úÖ Responsibility: Act as a persistent graph representation where each document corresponds to a direct route between two cities with its fare and transport mode.

### 3. Modified Dijkstra Algorithim

This is the heart of Path-Panda. It reads data from the MongoDB database and creates a graph structure where:
Nodes = Cities
Edges = Direct routes (bus/train) with weights = fare

- Then it applies a modified Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm to find the cheapest path from the source to destination, considering multiple transport modes.

#### 3.1 Working of Modified Dijkstra to accomadate Mutiple Modes of Travel

we model each city as two nodes:

Example: Kanpur_Train and Kanpur_Bus

üîÅ Mode Switch
Each city has a zero or low-cost edge between its \_Train and \_Bus nodes to allow mode switching (e.g., Delhi_Train ‚Üî Delhi_Bus).

üó∫Ô∏è Graph Construction

- Nodes: City_Mode (e.g., Delhi_Bus)
- Edges: Travel routes with fare as weight (from database)
- We run a modified Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm:
- Start from both Source_Train and Source_Bus
- Explore cheapest path using fares as weights
- Switch modes when needed
- Stop at Destination_Train or Destination_Bus

#### A Sample Path:

‚úÖ Responsibility: Calculate the optimal (cheapest) path across different modes from point A to point B.
